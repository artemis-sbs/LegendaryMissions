This is the overview

# [Console Stations](consoles)

Describe what stations are

## [Helm](helm)

The Helm console steers the ship using the maneuvering system and moves the ship using impluse and warp drive (for Terrans) or jump drive (for Ximni). 
Helm can also initiate a docking sequence with a friendly base to allow refueling, then release the dock so the ship can be on its way.
Your warp drive (or jump drive) can go faster and farther than your enemies, but it consumes a lot of energy.
To make the ship turn faster, ask Engineering for more power to maneuvering.
To make the ship move faster, ask Engineering for more power to the impulse or warp drive.

## [Weapons](weapons)

The Weapons console controls your beam weapons and your torpedoes.
Enemy shields are more vulnerable to beam weapons adjusted to their weakest frequency. The Science Officer can tell you which frequency is weakest on each enemy ship.
Weapons can arm and fire torpedoes with variety of warheads. Homing torpedoes are the cheapest and do moderate damage to one target. EMP torpedoes have a large blast radius, damaging the shields of anything caught in their blast. Nukes also have a large blast radius, severely damaging anything caught in their blast. Mines are like Nukes but they drop behind your ship and explode when a target comes near.
In an emergency, Weapons can provide energy to your ship by draining a torpedo weapon.
To make your beam weapons hit harder, ask Engineering to increase power to beams.
To make your torpedo tubes load faster, ask Engineering to increase power to torpedo tubes.

## [Communications](comms)

The Communications console has a text scroll of incoming and outgoing messages, and is the voice of the ship.
Comms can taunt enemies, choosing from many biting insults, but each enemy will respond to only one taunt. The wrong taunt will get the enemy to laugh at you and cut off communications, so ask Science for advice on which taunt to use.
Comms can order friendly ships to change course, attacking or evading enemies.
Comms can request that friendly bases constuct torpedo weapons and expedite refuiling, rearming, and repairing your ship.
The comms station has a 'RED ALERT' button which will keep your crew on their toes.

## [Science](science)

The Science console is the eyes of the ship, locating and scanning virtually anything in the sector. The crew is counting on you to tell them what is going on out there, so don't play Science if you can't speak up!
When Science spots an unknown contact, you can select it with a click, then use an initial scan to identify it. 
Once identified, Science can run further scans to find out details about the contact, including status (such as sheilds) and intelligence reports (such as the taunts which will anger an enemy captain).
The further away an object is the longer it takes to scan.
To make your sensors scan faster, ask Engineering to increase power to sensors.

## [Engineering](engineering)

The Engineering console has two main functions: to distribute power to the ship's systems and to direct damage control teams to repair damage to the ship.
If Helm, Weapons, and Science are doing their jobs well, they will all be demanding then you transfer more power to their systems.
Systems like sensors, weapons, and engines can overheat. If a system overheats beyond its limits it will be damaged and require repairs.
Every system can dissipate some heat naturally, so systems you set to 100% (normal) power do not overheat. When you increase power above 100% heat will build up toward an overheat.
Engineering has a pool of coolant available to cool down overheated systems. You don't have enough coolant to cool everything all at once, so distribute it carefully.
